## ðŸ“Œ Project Introduction

DataMed is a Machine-Learning web platform that  predicts severity of Disease. So far, we've deployed Heart Failure and Breast Cancer(tumour proliferation) prediction models.

### What makes DataMed different ?

* Models are updated frequently on new datasets to ensure the best user experience.  
* It's minimalistic user interface makes it easier to make use of it even for a non tech-savvy person.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem It Solves

* Heart failures can be prevented with early monitoring of the chances of heart failure based on vitals and habits of patients. This can be done using DataMed's Heart Failure prediction tool that provides an opportunity to check the chances of heart failure based on certain parameters. Besides, in this time of the global pandemic, it's not feasible for doctors to address every patient individually. 

* Many fatal diseases like cancer can be cured if it's observed in the early stages.DataMed's Breast Cancer prediction tool provides such a feature to predict whether breast tumour is malignant or benign. If it turns out malignant for a patient then that patient needs an adequate amount of breast cancer treatment instead of normal tumour treatment as in case if it turns out benign.

## ðŸ“Œ Technology Stack Used
